# LKBX Recovery

If you're reading this, then you need to flash your device with fresh firmware. Maybe your device is bricked, or you just want to start fresh.

Don't worryâ€”it's not the end of the world. This guide will help you recover your LKBX.

In this repository, you'll find a functioning LKBX firmware that you can flash to your device to recover it.

## Requirements

- A computer running Windows, macOS, or Linux
- A USB-C cable
- An LKBX device
- PlatformIO installed on your computer
- Git installed on your computer
- A bit of technical knowledge
- A bit of patience

## Instructions

1. **Clone this repository** to your computer.
2. **Connect your LKBX** to your computer using a USB-C cable.
3. **Open a terminal** and navigate to the directory where you cloned this repository.
4. **Flash the firmware** to your LKBX by running:

   ```bash
   pio run
   ```

5. **Wait for the flashing process to complete**. Once it's done, your LKBX should be recovered.

## Troubleshooting

### Error: `firmware.bin` not found

This error occurs when you've already attempted to flash using the `pio run` command. PlatformIO may have deleted the `firmware.bin` file after flashing, but it's still in the Git history.

To fix this, run:

```bash
git checkout .
```

This will revert all your local changes and restore the `.pio/build/production/firmware.bin` file.

### Error: The port doesn't exist

- **Ensure no other program** is using the serial port. On Windows, you can check this in the Device Manager.
- **Unplug and replug** the LKBX, or try a different USB port.
- **Restart your computer** if the issue persists.

### Error: Upload successful but LKBX still not working

If you erased the flash memory of your LKBX, you'll need to flash the bootloader first.

1. **Install an empty project** to your LKBX:

   ```bash
   pio run -e bootloader
   ```

2. If you see the message **"LKBX Ready to upload firmware."**, proceed to flash the firmware.
3. **Stop the process** with `Ctrl+C`.
4. **Flash the firmware** by running:

   ```bash
   pio run
   ```

### Error: Serial port not found / No serial data

If PlatformIO cannot communicate with your LKBX:

- **Power cycle your LKBX** by opening the back of your device and unplugging the battery.
    - *Note: If you're not comfortable doing this, please don't attempt it.*
    - Opening your LKBX may void your warranty. 
- **Contact R&D** for further assistance.
