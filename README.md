# LKBX Recovery

If you're reading this, then you need to flash your device with fresh firmware. Maybe your device is bricked, or you just want to start fresh.

Don't worryâ€”it's not the end of the world. This guide will help you recover your LKBX.

In this repository, you'll find a functioning LKBX firmware that you can flash to your device to recover it.

# Requirements

- A computer running Windows, macOS, or Linux
- A USB-C cable
- An LKBX device
- PlatformIO installed on your computer
- Git installed on your computer
- A bit of technical knowledge
- A bit of patience

# Instructions

1. **Clone this repository** to your computer.
2. **Connect your LKBX** to your computer using a USB-C cable.
3. **Open a terminal** and navigate to the directory where you cloned this repository.
4. **Flash the firmware** to your LKBX by running:

   ```bash
   pio run
   ```

5. **Wait for the flashing process to complete**. Once it's done, your LKBX should be recovered.

# Troubleshooting

## Error: `firmware.bin` not found

This error occurs when you've already attempted to flash using the `pio run` command. PlatformIO may have deleted the `firmware.bin` file after flashing, but it's still in the Git history.

To fix this, run:

```bash
git checkout .
```

This will revert all your local changes and restore the `.pio/build/production/firmware.bin` file.

## Error: Not responding
This is a class of errors which may include messages like the following:
- `The port doesn't exist`
- `Device reports readiness to read but returned no data`
- `Serial data stream stopped: Possible serial noise or corruption.`
- `A fatal error occurred: The chip stopped responding.`

Typically this means some other process is using the serial port.

- **Ensure no other program** is using the serial port. Check all browers, IDE's and terminals.
- **Make sure no pio processes** are running that might be using the serial port.
- **Unplug and replug** the LKBX, or try a different USB port.
- **Restart your computer** if the issue persists.
- **If this fails**, Proceed to the next section.

## Error: Upload successful but LKBX still not working

If you erased the flash memory of your LKBX, you'll need to flash the bootloader first.

1. **Install an empty project** to your LKBX:

   ```bash
   pio run -e bootloader
   ```

2. If you see the message **"LKBX Ready to upload firmware."**, proceed to flash the firmware.
3. **Stop the process** with `Ctrl+C`.
4. **Flash the firmware** by running:

   ```bash
   pio run
   ```

## Error: Serial port not found / No serial data

If PlatformIO cannot communicate with your LKBX, and you've tried all the troubleshooting steps above, you may need power cycle your LKBX.

- **Power cycle your LKBX** by opening the back of your device and unplugging the battery.
    - *Note: Doing this may void your warranty. Contact R&D before proceeding*
    - *Note: If you're not comfortable doing this, please don't attempt it.*

If you are not comfortable power cycling your LKBX, please contact R&D for further assistance.

If you've disconnected the battery and reconnected it, then try following this guide form the top.
If that still doesn't work, please contact R&D for further assistance.
